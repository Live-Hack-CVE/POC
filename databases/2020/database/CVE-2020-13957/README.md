# CVE-2020-13957

Apache Solr versions 6.6.0 to 6.6.6, 7.0.0 to 7.7.3 and 8.0.0 to 8.6.2 prevents some features considered dangerous (which could be used for remote code execution) to be configured in a ConfigSet that's uploaded via API without authentication/authorization. The checks in place to prevent such features can be circumvented by using a combination of UPLOAD/CREATE actions.
