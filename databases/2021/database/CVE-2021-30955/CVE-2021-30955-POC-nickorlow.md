## Readme

# CVE-2021-30955 POC
Proof of concept (wrapped into an iOS app) for  CVE-2021-30955
All credit to Jake James. His POC code (used in this project) can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/jakeajames/37f72c58c775bfbdda3aa9575149a8aa).

### What is this?
This demonstrates CVE-2021-30955, an iOS bug which allows an app in userspace to gain kernel-level permissions. In order to demonstrate this, this POC crashes the kernel of an iOS device.

### Why?
This can (by someone other than me) be turned into an iOS Jailbreak (or something nasty like spyware). This repository was created in order to let people test the POC out on their own iDevices since Jake James only provided a C file.

### Attributions
