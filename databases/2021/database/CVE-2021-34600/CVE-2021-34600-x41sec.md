# Proof of Concept for CVE-2021-34600

A detailed explanation of how this PoC works can be found within our [blog
post](https://x41-dsec.de/lab/blog/telenot-complex-insecure-keygen/).

On the user facing side we only added two new commands: `hf 14a getchallenge
<uid>` and `hf 14a opendoor <uid> <key>`. To make those work, we had to mix
some code from the [iceman
fork](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3) into the official
[proxmark3](https://github.com/Proxmark/proxmark3) code. We originally tried to
develop on top of the iceman fork, but for some reason the reader wouldn't want
to talk to the proxmark when emulating a tag. The official code didn't have
that issue so we went with the (somewhat ugly) path of least resistance and
copied `desfire_crypto.{c,h}` and its dependencies into the official proxmark3
repo.

We provide an `annotated-trace` file showing the communication between a tag
and the reader. There are some tests for `SimulateIso14443aTag` you can run by
setting `run_tests` to `true` and running the command in the comments above it.
They play through the exact same commands as within the `annotated-trace` file
and ensure that `SimulateIso14443aTag` answers correctly.

# proxmark3:Â the official Proxmark repository!

The proxmark3 is a powerful general purpose RFID tool, the size of a deck
of cards, designed to snoop, listen and emulate everything from
**Low Frequency (125kHz)** to **High Frequency (13.56MHz)** tags.

This repository contains enough software, logic (for the FPGA), and design
documentation for the hardware that you could, at least in theory,
do something useful with a proxmark3.

## Development

The tools required to build  or run the project will vary depending on
your operating system. Please refer to [the wiki](https://github.com/Proxmark/proxmark3/wiki) for details.

## Obtaining hardware

The Proxmark3 is available for purchase (assembled and tested) from the
following locations:

| Distributor Name | Warehouse Location | Entity Location |
|------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| [RyscCorp](https://proxmark3.com/)         | USA                | USA             |
| [Hackerwarehouse](https://hackerwarehouse.com/)  | USA                | USA             |
| [Elechouse](http://www.elechouse.com/)        | HK                 | HK              |
| [Lab401](https://lab401.com/)           | EU                 | HK              |
| [RFxSecure](http://www.rfxsecure.com/)       | CN                 | SG              |
| [Sneaktechnology](https://www.sneaktechnology.com/)  | CN                 | CN              |

   
Most of the ultra-low-volume contract assemblers could put
something like this together with a reasonable yield. A run of around
a dozen units is probably cost-effective. The BOM includes (possibly-
outdated) component pricing, and everything is available from Digikey
and the usual distributors.

If you've never assembled a modern circuit board by hand, then this is
not a good place to start. Some of the components (e.g. the crystals)
must not be assembled with a soldering iron, and require hot air.

The schematics are included; the component values given are not
necessarily correct for all situations, but it should be possible to do
nearly anything you would want with appropriate population options.

The printed circuit board artwork is also available, as Gerbers and an
Excellon drill file.
