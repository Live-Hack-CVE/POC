## Readme

# CVE-2021-36934
SeriousSAM Auto Exploiter

# Requirements
- HiveNightmare , executable or a DLL equivelant of it (the DLL equivelant would require some code modifications in order to run it through rundll32, this could be useful when you run into applocker environments.)
- dump.exe m  which is a pyinstaller compiled secretsdump.py so its pretty large since it contains all modules and python itself into it. (Reason you dont need this as a DLL because you can also invoke this server side along with the hashcat API if you want, that would actually be way more effective and stealthy)
- hashcat API , this is a PHP API I made to pass hashes into which can crack most hashes within 5-10 seconds, this is way more efficient than NTLM rainbow tables. 
You can see the code here: https://github.com/websecnl/hashcat-php-API


This project is not yet finished but suite yourself and make something cool from it, just do it for Educational and Research purposes and not for the purpose to do harm to others!
