# CVE-2021-25076

The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before 3.5.26 does not validate and escape the status parameter before using it in a SQL statement in the Subscribers dashboard, leading to an SQL injection. Due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping, this could also lead to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
