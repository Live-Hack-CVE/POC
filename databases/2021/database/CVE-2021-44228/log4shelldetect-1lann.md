## Readme

# log4shelldetect

Scans a file or folder recursively for Java programs that may be vulnerable to:

- CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) (v2.0.x - v2.14.x)
- CVE-2021-45046 (v2.15.x)
- CVE-2021-45105 (v2.16.x)[^*]

[^*]: 2.12.2 detection is not available yet pending 2.12.3's release which I will need to test. 2.12.2 will appear as patched.

by inspecting the class paths inside files.

If you only want possibly vulnerable files to be printed rather than all files, run with `-mode list`.
