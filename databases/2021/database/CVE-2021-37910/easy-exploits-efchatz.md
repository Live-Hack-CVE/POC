# easy-exploits

The current repository contains exploits of different CVE IDs that were identified in the past by me (CVE-2021-37910, CVE-2021-40288, CVE-2021-41435, CVE-2021-41436,  CVE-2021-41437, CVE-2021-41441, CVE-2021-41442, CVE-2021-41445, CVE-2021-41449, CVE-2021-41450, CVE-2021-41451, CVE-2021-41753, CVE-2021-41788, CVE-2021-46353, CVE-2022-41540, CVE-2022-41541).


## Motivation

The main purpose of this repository is to give an easy access to these exploits, since they are mentioned in each published manuscript and needed to be formatted, in order to be executed.


## Repository overview

Each directory is separated based on the affected protocol that the attack is escalated and the relevant CVE ID.

## Running instructions

For Web attacks, any curl tool stable version should be suffice. For Wi-Fi atacks, Python3 and Scapy 2.4.1 should be enough to use an exploit.


## More resources

The following refers to the original publication manuscripts, in which these exploits were taken, in case anyone needs more information for a vulnerability. For the DoS attacks on Wi-Fi, check [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221421262100243X) paper. While, for the Web attacks, [this](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2022/1833062/) paper.
