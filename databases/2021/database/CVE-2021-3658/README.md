# CVE-2021-3658

bluetoothd from bluez incorrectly saves adapters' Discoverable status when a device is powered down, and restores it when powered up. If a device is powered down while discoverable, it will be discoverable when powered on again. This could lead to inadvertent exposure of the bluetooth stack to physically nearby attackers.
