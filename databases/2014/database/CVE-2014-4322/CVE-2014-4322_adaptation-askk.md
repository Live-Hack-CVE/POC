# CVE-2014-4322_adaptation
Just an attempt to adapt for Note 4, I do not know what I am doing.
There is currently a way to write to system using ADB (CVE-2014-7951 and CVE-2014-7953). 
zxz0O0 has confirmed writing to system works. 
What we needed was to gain System UID to execute CVE-2014-4322.
I am looking at how CVE-2014-4322 works to see if I could wrap it in an APK which may already be done in giefroot.
And then to check use terms of installing SuperUser.
If anyone by chance looks at this, I am a complete novice and I have absolutely no idea what I am doing.
