## Readme

# CVE-2018-19320

Exploiting ring0 memcpy-like functionality to disable Driver Signing Enforcement (DSE) as documented here: http://deniable.org/windows/windows-callbacks

### Disclaimer

This is exploit is released in the interest of exploring the Windows kernel for self-education. I take zero responsibility for bugchecks, and for whatever you do with this. Don't be stupid. 

### Usage

### Demo

Is this exploit PatchGuard friendly? Please read http://deniable.org/windows/windows-callbacks. Short answer is `CI.dll` variables are protected by `PatchGuard` indeed (starting with Windows 8.1). However, this doesn't mean we'll get an instant `PatchGuard` action (**bugcheck**). This will eventually lead to a **bugcheck** when `PatchGuard` notices the change. However, if we revert the change (restore the original state) **we'll be fine**. There's a risk here obviously, as we don't know when is `PatchGuard` going to look at our global variable. `PatchGuard` runs randomly, so it can happen immediately after our change, 5 minutes later, one hour later, 24 hours later, we don't know.

### Driver

You'll have to find the vulnerable driver yourself. Again, don't be stupid. Use if for self-education only.
