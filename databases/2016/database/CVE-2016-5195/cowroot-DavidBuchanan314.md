# cowroot
Universal Android root tool based on CVE-2016-5195. Watch this space.

### Current Status:
  - Only works on 32-bit devices
  - Only able to get root on Cyanogenmod devices, when both getuid() and geteuid() are patched (i.e. bypasses su checks).

I've ported https://gist.github.com/scumjr/17d91f20f73157c722ba2aea702985d2 to Android arm32.

As a proof-of-concept, it patches getuid() and geteuid() in libc to always return 0. Unless there is a su binary like on Cyanogenmod devices, this doesn't do anything useful. vDSO is not patched because many Android kernels do not have it enabled.

In order to get "real" root, I'm going to have to use a different patching strategy.

If I patch a function that is used by an already-privileged process, I should be able to get full control.
