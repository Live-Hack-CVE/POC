# RSCD_CVEs
My research and works about the CVE 2016-5063/1542/1543 about the RSCD agent


You will find two different files in this repo:

- one that was adapted from @bao7uo, as its script was for python 2 and the formatting was not working anymore for python 3. It allows the attacker to Get some intel about the host OS and a listing of the users of the server.
This vulnerability works up until the version 8.6 patch 1.

- A second script that allows Remote Code Execution on the server through the vulnerabilities listed above.
I was able to curl a file and execute it without any problem. I guess you can do pretty much anything from this.

Usage :

IntelGathering : python IntelGatheringWindows.py 192.168.1.30 (-p 4750) #default port is 4750

RCE_RSCD : python RCE_RSCD.py (-p 4750) 192.168.1.30 "cmd /c 'echo Got pwned !' "
