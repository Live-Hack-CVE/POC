## BMC_rexec.py Overview

This method of remote execution was achieved by doing my own research - it is performed using XMLRPC and has only been tested against Windows. The script will hang, but the command should execute.

Nick Bloor has a much better execution exploit using a different technique:

## BMC_winUsers.py Overview

After some research I was able to pull Windows users from the Windows BMC agent over XML RPC, so I adapted the getUsers file from ernw/insinuator to make a Windows version (see the following screenshot). I also modified the ernw/insinuator version to make it a dual platform exploit.
