## Readme

# Exploiting-Stagefright-Vulnerability-CVE-2015-3864

Stagefright refers to a set of software flaws in Android versions 2.2 "Froyo" through 5.1.1 "Lollipop," which affected 95% of all Android phones still. If the vulnerability is exploited, an attacker can use remote code execution and privilege escalation to do arbitrary actions on the victim's device. So, in this project, I'm going to use this vulnerability to exploit Android 5.1.1 " Lollipop." 


Keywords: Android hacking, mobile phone hacking, Metasploit Framework.
