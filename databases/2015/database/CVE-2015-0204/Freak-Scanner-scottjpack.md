## Readme

# Freak-Scanner
Multithreaded Python FREAK scanner, used to detect SSL EXP Ciphers, vulnerable to CVE-2015-0204

It's pretty quick, should be able to scan just shy of 1k hosts in an hour.
The output is messy though, you'll have to grep on Vulnerable/NotVulnerable
I'll try to clean this up later if there's any demand for it.
