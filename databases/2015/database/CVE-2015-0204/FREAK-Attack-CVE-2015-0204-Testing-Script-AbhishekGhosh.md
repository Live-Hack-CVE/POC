# FREAK Attack CVE 20150204 Testing Script

Your server must score A+ to SSL Labs test under normal situation, should listed as HSTS Preload Listed website for better security.

Except renowned web service providers, do not test your own website on some mother f$$$r's server on SSL Lab. First test that server, it is not unusual to find security flaw on their website. 

The script is written as described method by Akamai. I written for our servers. You should not complain against it, because it is 100% free software. Normally on SSL Lab Test, you'll score A+ with with good settings. Casually test with this script for any extra issue. Most webmasters, frankly use very bad setup, can not even qualify to score A on SSL Labs.
