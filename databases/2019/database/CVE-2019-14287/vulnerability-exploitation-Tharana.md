Absolutely, I always choose Linux vulnerability, but then I had to choose different vulnerability else because I didn't know two people could do the same thing And then Having learned of this, I chose a different vulnerability, But because I had already solved that. This will include the report I did before and the new one I did later I've decided to include it separately Because I can't throw it away. Please request that you check both vulnerability report and come up with an idea
