# CVE-2019-1672

A vulnerability in the Decryption Policy Default Action functionality of the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured drop policy and allow traffic onto the network that should have been denied. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of SSL-encrypted traffic when Decrypt for End-User Notification is disabled in the configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a SSL connection through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a configured drop policy to block specific SSL connections. Releases 10.1.x and 10.5.x are affected.
