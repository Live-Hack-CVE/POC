## Readme

# SharpPolarBear

This is a weaponized version for one of the Exploits published by SandboxEscaper from here (https://github.com/SandboxEscaper/polarbearrepo). 

Most of the code comes from rasta-mouse CollectorService repository (https://github.com/rasta-mouse/CollectorService). I just changed the CVE-2019-0841-Code from the original SandboxEscaper C++ Code to C# and added some checks.

I have also added the required binaries (schtasks.exe, schedsvc.dll + an exported Windows XP Job File), which are unpacked during runtime and deleted afterwards. So you just need one binary here.

Windows Defender seams to have a heuristic detection for Applications creating a hardlink from C:\windows\system32\tasks to a file in C:\windows\system32\. So with Defender this executable is most likely blocked/detected.

You have to run the executable twice to get a system shell.
