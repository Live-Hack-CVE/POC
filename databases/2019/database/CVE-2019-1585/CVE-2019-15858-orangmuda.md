# CVE-2019-15858
**Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution at Woody Ad Snippets (PoC)**



An unauthenticated options import vulnerability combined with a stored XSS vulnerability can lead to remote code execution in the WordPress Woody Ad Snippets (90,000+ active installations).
Woody Ad Snippets is a plugin that allows administrators to insert any code, text, or ads by conditions in their blog: JS, CSS, HTML and even PHP code. It was prone in version 2.2.4 and below to two vulnerabilities that, when unintentionally triggered by the administrator in the back-end section of WordPress, would allow an attacker to run any PHP code in order to compromise the website and its database.

# Usage:
```
