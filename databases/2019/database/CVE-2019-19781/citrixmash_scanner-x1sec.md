# CVE-2019-19781 citrixmash scanner

A multithreaded scanner for Citrix appliances that are vulnerable to CVE-2019-19781.
The scanner does not attempt to compromise/exploit hosts and avoids downloading any sensitive content. A `HEAD` request is used to determine if a target is vulnerable. False positives are reduced by verifying a specific value in the content-length header response.

citrixsmash_scanner is capable of accepting both network ranges and accepting individual hosts. 

## Installation 
```
$ go get -u github.com/x1sec/citrixmash_scanner
```
Alternatively, compiled 64-bit executable files for Windows, Mac and Linux are available [here](https://github.com/x1sec/citrixmash_scanner/releases/)

## Usage
```
$ ./citrixsmash_scanner -h
  -e  Evade IDS with ASCII encoding (default true)
  -f string
      File containing list of hosts
  -n string
      Network in CIDR format (e.g. 192.168.0.0/24)
  -o string
      Write results to text file
  -t int
      HTTP timeout (seconds) (default 2)
  -u string
      Custom user agent string
  -v  Verbose
  -w int
      Number of concurrent workers (default 20)
```

Requests are concurrent with a default of 20 workers/threads. To speed up the scanning, increase workers (`-w`) and/or reduce the HTTP timeout (`-t`)

If either the `-n` or `f` parameters are omitted, citrixmash_scanner will accept input from stdin. 
For example, using subdomain enumeration with [assetfinder](https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder):
```
$ assetfinder corp.com | ./citrixmash_scanner 
```

Or for scanning a complete Autonomous System with [xpasn](https://github.com/x1sec/xpasn):
```
$ xpasn AS394161 | ./citrixmash_scanner 
```

Targets can be mixed (http, https), and include networks in CIDR format. If `http` or `https` is ommitted, then `https` will be used. The following is a valid target list:
```
$ cat targets.txt
http://target1.com
https://target2.org
192.168.0.2
http://10.0.0.4
10.0.20.0/24
```

Use the `-o <filename`> option to write vulnerable hosts to a text file.

### Example usage:
Options: verbose info (`-v`), 50 parallel workers (`-w`), 1 second timeout (`-t`), scanning subnet (`-n`) and also including hosts from `target.txt` (`-f`):

```
$ ./citrixmash_scanner -v -t 1 -w 50 -n 192.168.10.0/24 -f targets.txt
