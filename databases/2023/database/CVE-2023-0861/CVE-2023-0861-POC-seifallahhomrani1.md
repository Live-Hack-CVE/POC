### Analyzing and Reproducing the Command Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2023-0861) in NetModule Routers

NetModule is an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of industrial grade routers that are commonly used in critical
infrastructure and industrial control systems. On February 24th, 2023, ONEKEY, a security research firm, released a security
advisory disclosing a vulnerability that affect 9 NetModule routers. The vulnerability were identified within the web
management interface and allow authenticated users to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.
As an individual interested in IoT security and firmware analysis, I find it valuable to review the entire reproduction process of
reported vulnerabilities and In the pursuit of expanding my knowledge and skills, I took it upon myself to reproduce the
disclosed vulnerability.
