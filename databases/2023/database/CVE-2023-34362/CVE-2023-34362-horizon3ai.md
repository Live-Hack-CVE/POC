# CVE-2023-34362
POC for CVE-2023-34362 affecting MOVEit Transfer

## Technical Analysis
A technical root cause analysis of the vulnerability can be found on our blog:
https://www.horizon3.ai/moveit-transfer-cve-2023-34362-deep-dive-and-indicators-of-compromise/

## Summary
This POC abuses an SQL injection to obtain a sysadmin API access token and then use that access to abuse a deserialization call to obtain remote code execution.

This POC needs to reach out to an Identity Provider endpoint which hosts proper RS256 certificates used to forge arbitrary user tokens - by default this POC uses our IDP endpoint hosted in AWS.

By default, the exploit will write a file to C:\Windows\Temp\message.txt. Alternative payloads can be generated by using the ysoserial.net project.

## Usage
