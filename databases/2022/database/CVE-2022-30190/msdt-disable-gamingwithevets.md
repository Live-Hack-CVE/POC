## Readme

**NOTE**: This tool is now **obsolete**! [The Follina exploit is now **fixed** as of June 14, 2022.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-patches-actively-exploited-follina-windows-zero-day/)  
Which means: if you used this tool, you can now enable the MSDT protocol again... if you still have the backup .reg file, of course.

The **MSDT Protocol Disabler** is a tool that disables the MSDT protocol (`ms-msdt://`).  
It is a simple patch tool for patching the zero-day [CVE-2022-30190/Follina](https://doublepulsar.com/follina-a-microsoft-office-code-execution-vulnerability-1a47fce5629e) vulnerability.

A backup .reg file will be saved to your user folder in case you want to re-enable the protocol.
