## About the vulnerability

You can find the official advisory by Atlassian to this vulerability [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-security-advisory-2022-06-02-1130377146.html). For details about the inner workings and exploits in the wild you should refer to the reports by [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2022/06/02/active-exploitation-of-confluence-cve-2022-26134/) and [Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-observations-of-confluence-zero-day-cve-2022-26134/).
Affected but not yet patched systems should be deemed **compromised** until further investigation.

## About the tool

ConfluencePot is written in Golang and implements its own HTTPS server to minimize the overall attack surface. To make it appear like a legit Confluence instance it returns a bare-bones version of a Confluence landing page. Log output is written to stdout and a log file on disk. ConfluencePot **DOES NOT** allow attackers to execute commands/code on your machine, it only logs requests and returns a bogus response.

### Building & Running it

You need a recent version of Golang to run/build confluencePot and the appropriate privileges to bind to port 443. We recommend to execute it in a tmux session for easier handling. To run ConfluencePot you either need to create a self-signed TLS certificate with *openssl* or request one from e.g. *Let's Encrypt*.

```
go build confluencePot.go
./confluencePot
```

## Testing and Issues

ConfluencePot was tested using the public exploit by [Nwqda](https://github.com/Nwqda/CVE-2022-26134), which seems to be the most used variant in the wild at the time of writing.
