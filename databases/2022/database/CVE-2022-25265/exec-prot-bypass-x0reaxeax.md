# Executable Space Protection Bypass (CVE-2022-25265)

This POC demonstrates execution of bytes located in supposedly non-executable region of binary, therefore completely bypassing executable-space protection.  

The root cause of this can be found here:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/include/asm/elf.h#L280  

## Brief
As it turns out, binary files built on either systems lacking NX or IA32 systems with NX, which do NOT contain the `PT_GNU_STACK` header will be marked with `exec-all`.  
This allows for complete RWX to/from everywhere in the binary.  


To achieve this, we use "historical" building tools.  
In this case, gcc 3.2.2 running on x86 Slackware9 with Linux 2.4.20  
We will end up with a binary file which can be executed on modern Linux systems, in this case **Linux 5.16.1**

The very same effect MIGHT be achievable with specific linker arguments/scripts, although I have NOT verified this.

The following code will copy assembled bytes of function `dummy()` to character array `harmless_str_buf` and execute the destination array as function.
