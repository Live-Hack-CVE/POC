Stack-based buffer overflow in the libbecompat library in Ingres 2.6, Ingres 2006 release 1 (aka 9.0.4), and Ingres 2006 release 2 (aka 9.1.0) on Linux and HP-UX allows local users to gain privileges by setting a long value of an environment variable before running (1) verifydb, (2) iimerge, or (3) csreport. "Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the "ingres" user. By itself, this vulnerability does not have very serious consequences. However, when combined with the library loading vulnerability, it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. " (iDefense) "Fixes are available for the current release of Ingres 2006 release 2 (9.1.0), for Ingres 2006 release 1 (9.0.4), and for Ingres 2.6 versions on their respective platforms.
