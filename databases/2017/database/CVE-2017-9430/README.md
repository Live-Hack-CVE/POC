# CVE-2017-9430

Stack-based buffer overflow in dnstracer through 1.9 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a command line with a long name argument that is mishandled in a strcpy call for argv[0]. An example threat model is a web application that launches dnstracer with an untrusted name string.
