A Burp extension to detect and exploit versions of Telerik Web UI vulnerable to [CVE-2017-9248](https://www.telerik.com/support/kb/aspnet-ajax/details/cryptographic-weakness). This extension is based on the original exploit tool written by Paul Taylor ([@bao7uo](https://twitter.com/bao7uo)) which is available at [https://github.com/bao7uo/dp_crypto](https://github.com/bao7uo/dp_crypto). Credits and big thanks to him. 

A related blog post on how to exploit web applications via Telerik Web UI can also be found [here](https://capt-meelo.github.io/pentest/2018/08/03/pwning-with-telerik.html).

### Features
* Detect vulnerable versions of Telerik Web UI during passive scans.
* Bruteforce the key and discover the "Document Manager" link just like the original exploit tool.

### Installation

1. Download [telewreck.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capt-meelo/Telewreck/master/telewreck.py) to your machine.
2. Install Python's **requests** module using `sudo pip install requests`.
2. On your Burp, go to _**Extender > Options**_ tab. Then under the **Python Environment** section, locate your **jython-standalone-2.7.0.jar** file (1) and the directory where Python's requests module is located (2).

3. Go to _**Extender > Extensions**_ tab, then click on the _**Add**_ button. On the new window, browse the location of **telewreck.py** and click the _**Next**_ button.

### Notes
1. This extension requires Python's **requests** module. Just run `pip install requests` to install it.
2. The text area under Telewreck tab doesn't function as a console. So, `stoud` and `stderr` outputs cannot be seen there. However, you can view them under the **Output** and **Errors** sections of the **Extender** tab.
3. Before running another bruteforce, cancel the current process first by clicking the **Cancel** button.
4. If the key can't be bruteforced, then probably the key has been set up securely and/or the application is not using a default installation of Telerik.
5. If the key can't be bruteforced and/or there are some issues, it's recommended to fall back to the original exploit tool. 


### To Do
1. Locate Telerik.Web.UI.DialogHandler.aspx
