# Weblogic_Wsat_RCE

POC for CVE-2017-10271. Since java.lang.ProcessBuilder was the original vector for RCE, there are multiple signature based rules that block this particular payload. Added java.lang.Runtime and will add others in the future. This is for educational purposes only: I take no responsibility for how you use this code.
