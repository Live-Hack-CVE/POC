# bleed

bleed is a tool to test servers for the '[Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com)' vulnerability ([CVE-2014-0160](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160)).

## Usage

```
$ bleed example.org
> Connecting...
> Sending Client Hello
  Waiting for Server Hello...
< Received message: type = 22, ver = 0302, length = 61
< Received message: type = 22, ver = 0302, length = 6442
< Received message: type = 22, ver = 0302, length = 331
< Received message: type = 22, ver = 0302, length = 4
> Sending Heartbeat request
Unexpected EOF receiving record header. Server closed connection.
No heartbeat response. Server likely not vulnerable.
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* The package manager [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).
* Composer global vendor directory in your path (e.g. `export PATH=~/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH`).
* You might have to add `"minimum-stability": "dev"` to your global `composer.json` (by default in `~/.composer/composer.json`).

### Actual installation

```
composer global require 'dominik/bleed=dev-master'
```

Composer will now install `bleed` and its dependencies.

## Updating

```
composer global update 'dominik/bleed'
```

## Fineprint

*As your attorney, I advise you* to not use this software to do stuff that's not legal under the laws applicable to wherever you may be located and whatever you are doing with it. If you need an analogy: It may be allowed to run over things in your own backyard with your car, but in most jurisdictions it's probably illegal to run over things in the streets.
