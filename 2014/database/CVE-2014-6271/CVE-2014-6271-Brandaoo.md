This script checks if a website is vulnerable to the Shellshock vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271).

Summary:

The Shellshock vulnerability, also known as Bashdoor, is a security flaw that was discovered in September 2014 in the Unix Bash shell. The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or commands on a system by exploiting a flaw in the way Bash handles environment variables. This can potentially give attackers complete control over a vulnerable system.

If the site is vulnerable to Shellshock, the script will output:

If the site is not vulnerable to Shellshock, the script will output:

Site example.com is not vulnerable to Shellshock
