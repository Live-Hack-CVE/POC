# CVE-202130858

Hi there! Thanks for testing out my first Github repository & attempt to implement a webkit vulnerability test! So you are aware: I did not discover this exploit, and I also did not write most of this code. So far, I have started off with modifying existing code to begin to learn how this all works. Let me know how your experience went!
