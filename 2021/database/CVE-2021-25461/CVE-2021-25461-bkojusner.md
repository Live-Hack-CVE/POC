# CVE-2021-25461

This is a repo with the Proof of Concept for the CVE discovered for the SAUSAGE (Security Analysis of Unix domain Socket usAGE in Android) paper that was accepted to EuroS&P 2022.  

I worked on this paper with [Mounir Elgharabawy](https://github.com/mounir-khaled), the one who discovered the vuln and wrote the Proof of Concept. His repo on the CVE can be seen [here](https://github.com/mounir-khaled/CVE-2021-25461).
