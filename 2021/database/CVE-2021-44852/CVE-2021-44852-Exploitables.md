# CVE-2021-44852

An issue was discovered in BS_RCIO64.sys in Biostar RACING GT Evo 2.1.1905.1700. A low-integrity process can open the driver's device object and issue IOCTLs to read or write to arbitrary physical memory locations (or call an arbitrary address), leading to execution of arbitrary code. This is associated with 0x226040, 0x226044, and 0x226000.

# CVE-2021-44852
 An issue was discovered in BS_RCIO64.sys in Biostar RACING GT Evo 2.1.1905.1700. A low-integrity process can open the driver's device object and issue IOCTLs to read or write to arbitrary physical memory locations (or call an arbitrary address), leading to execution of arbitrary code. This is associated with 0x226040, 0x226044, and 0x226000.

 I recall conducting research on this particular vulnerability, considering it impossible to exploit. Well, that analysis would have been true if I was analyzing the correct function for IO control codes. Needless to say, I could not have been any more wrong.
 
 To prove myself wrong, I went through and wrote up an entire exploit without the usage of external resources (besides the CVE details). In this repository, you can find a weaponized exploit tested on Windows 7 SP1 64-bit.
