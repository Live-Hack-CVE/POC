## Readme

# log4shell
Python Script to scan the server file system for log4j jars that are vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. The script recursively goes through the file system (including zip, ear, war) to find log4j versions 2.* to 2.15 with org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class.

The script takes the file system path to scan and lists down the vulnerable jar File Path, Bundle-Version, and Bundle-Name. The values are colon ":" separated. This output format is useful if the script is executed by an orchestration tool like Ansible and needs to be machine-readable.

The script supports additional options --Summary and --UnprocessedFiles to print more details of the scan.
