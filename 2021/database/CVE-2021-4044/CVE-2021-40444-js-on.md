## Readme

"Fork" of [lockedbytes](https://github.com/lockedbyte) CVE-2021-40444 PoC
===
Folks, I tried to port his [PoC](https://github.com/lockedbyte/CVE-2021-40444) for usage on Win using given modules for that, but I think I messed up at some point... Connection to the local server will be established but either my CAB file is corrupt or the generated DOCX.

## Usage
All variables will be read from **config.json** and can be changed there.
### Generate CAB and DOCX
`python3 3xpl01t.py gen`
### Start test server
`python3 3xpl01t.py srv`

## Structure
- **A Letter before court 4**: original sample downloaded from any.run (used as a template)
- **data**: like a temp folder ^^
- **3xpl01t.py**: the name says it all.
- **calc.cab**: original CAB file from lockedbytes PoC
- **config.json**: hopefully the configuration is self explaining ...
- **cve.***: 
  - **cve.nim**: code for generating custom DLLs (compile with: `nim c -d=mingw --app=lib --nomain --cpu=amd64 .\cve.nim`)
  - **cve.dll**: output of the given command
  - **cve.cab**: generated and patched CAB file (not working!)
- **malicious.docx**: generated DOCX file
- **methods.py**: this is where the partly working magic happens
- **side.html**: patched entry file ([stolen from lockedbyte](https://github.com/lockedbyte/CVE-2021-40444/blob/master/srv/deob.html))

## Improvements
- Add a MD to DOCX Engine to customize your malicious documents
- Get rid of the config file and work with arguments ^^ (was easier to test with a config ;))
- Automated sending of emails
- ...


## Conclusion
If you really wanna exploit CVE-2021-40444 you need to patch this approach or go directly with the mentioned PoC. If you wanna fix the unknown issue here, feel free to pull your changes and I will happily merge shit together!
> remember deactivating the Defender when testing ...., not the best approach, but its windows, so what do you expect??!
