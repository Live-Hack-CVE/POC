# CVE-2021-31166 Detection Rules
Different rules to detect if CVE-2021-31166 is being exploited

Rules available:
- Suricata
- Snort
  - The snort rules also work on suricata.
- Zeek

To Do:
- Make PCAPs available which where used during the development of the signatures

# Zeek script
- Detection when the CVE-2021-31166 vulnerability is being exploited.
- Detection if the 'exploited host' is down (this has a high threshold and may give some false negatives).
- Only detect on a given subnet. Default: 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12 and 10.0.0.0/8.
- Learn hosts that have IIS installed or have the WinRM or WSDAPI enabled an thus may be vulnerable. Only detect for the exploit on those hosts after they have been found. 
  - This feature is turned off by default. Change the value of `learn_iis_webservers` to `T` if you want it turned on.
