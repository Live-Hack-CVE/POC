# CVE-2021-34527-PrintNightmare-Workaround

This simple PowerShell script is in response to the "PrintNightmare" vulnerability. This was designed to give a end user the ability to stop and disable the "Print Spooler" service on their computer while awaiting a fix from Microsoft.

When the service is not running and a user runs the script, it gives them the option to re-enable the service for ten minutes while they print the jobs they need to, after the time has elapsed, it stops and disables the service. It also gives them the option to turn on the service until it is turned off again.

## Usage/Instructions

Simply run the script with PowerShell and follow the prompts. PowerShell will request admin privledges to perform needed actions.

## Contributions

Have ideas or suggestions to make this script better? I'd love to look into it.

## Donations

While this script is fairly simple, I still have some time and knowledge into developing it. If you found it useful, feel free to send your thanks.
