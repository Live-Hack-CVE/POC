# In-Spectre-Meltdown

This tool allows to check speculative execution side-channel attacks that affect many modern processors and operating systems designs. CVE-2017-5754 (Meltdown) and CVE-2017-5715 (Spectre) allows unprivileged processes to steal secrets from privileged processes. These attacks present 3 different ways of attacking data protection measures on CPUs enabling attackers to read data they shouldn't be able to. This tool is originally based on Microsoft: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4073119/protect-against-speculative-execution-side-channel-vulnerabilities-in
