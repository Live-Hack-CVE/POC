## Readme

CVE-2017-5123
===================
Linux privilege escalation exploiting `waitid` syscall.  The exploit is brought
to you by [@XeR\_0x2A][] and [@chaign\_c][] from [HexpressoTeam][hexpresso] for
educational purposes only.  
The bug was introduced the 2017-05-21 and fixed 2017-10-09, 4.14.0-rc4+ is
known vulnerable.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/BeRNWtrX27yF28CMeflqHQT0H.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/BeRNWtrX27yF28CMeflqHQT0H)

If you have a beginner/intermediate exploit writer level, we encourage you to
exploit it yourself before reading our implementation. It is a very good
exercise with an easy exploit primitive (arbitrary write to writable kernel
memory).  
We also challenge [@LiveOverflow][] to give it a try.

Here is the description:

> **oss-security:**  
> Hi,
> 
> Chris Salls discovered that when the waitid() syscall in Linux kernel  
> v4.13 was refactored, it accidentally stopped checking that the  
> incoming argument was pointing to userspace. This allowed local  
> attackers to write directly to kernel memory, which could lead to  
> privilege escalation.

> **waitid:**  
> waitid -- wait for a child process to change state.  
```c
int waitid(idtype_t idtype, id_t id, siginfo_t *infop, int options);
```

The kernel doesn't check whether `infop` is a kernelland or an userland
pointer, so we can overwrite memory of any kernel memory page with write
permissions. The fun part is that we only control partially what is written.  
There are more than a thousand ways to exploit this. We decided to turn this
write primitive into a null pointer dereference. We overwrote the
`have_canfork_callback` variable in the .BSS section of the kernel. Setting
this variable to anything else than 0 (true) will cause an unset
callback (null) to be "called on a new task before the process is exposed".

Thanks to Chris Salls and [@kees\_cook][] for sharing the CVE.

First "real world" linux kernel exploit of
