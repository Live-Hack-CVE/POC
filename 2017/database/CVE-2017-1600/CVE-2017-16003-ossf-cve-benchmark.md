On Windows? Want to compile native Node modules? Install the build tools with this one-liner:

```
npm install --global windows-build-tools
```

After installation, npm will automatically execute this module, which downloads and installs Visual C++ Build Tools 2015, provided free of charge by Microsoft. These tools are [required to compile popular native modules](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp). It will also install Python 2.7, configuring your machine and npm appropriately.

 > :bulb: [Windows Vista / 7 only] requires [.NET Framework 4.5.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40773) (Currently not installed automatically by this package)

Both installations are conflict-free, meaning that they do not mess with existing installations of Visual Studio, C++ Build Tools, or Python. If you see anything that indiciates otherwise, please file a bug.

## Contents

 - Visual C++ Compilers (targeting x86, X64 and ARM)
 - Visual C++ headers & libraries (CRT & STL)
 - Visual C++ build scripts (targeting Windows desktop)
 - Microsoft Build Tools 2015 (MSBuild)
 - Windows SDK 8.1 (optional, on by default)
 - Windows SDK 10 (optional, off by default)
 - ATL and MFC (optional, off by default)
 - C++ Build tools specific command prompts

## Proxy
If you're behind a proxy, set a `PROXY` environment variable first. To do that with PowerShell, simply run `$env:PROXY = "Your proxy"`.

## Mirror
Microsoft's build tools should be fast across the world, but to use a mirror to download Python, set a `PYTHON_MIRROR` environment variable. To do that with PowerShell, simply run `npm install --global windows-build-tools --python_mirror=https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors/python/`.

## Support & Help

This package currently only handles the most common use case, none of the edge cases. If you encounter errors, we'd greatly appreciate [error reports](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools) (and even pull requests). This is currently tested on Windows 10.

#### Where is Python installed?
It's saved under `%USERPROFILE%\.windows-build-tools\python27`.

#### 'Python' is not recognized as a command
To not mess with your machine in unnecessary ways, Python is only installed to disk and configured with npm. If you'd like for the `python` command to work in `cmd.exe` and PowerShell, add the folder `%USERPROFILE%\.windows-build-tools\python27` to your environment variables.

## License & Credits

The Python installation was made possible by [Ali Hajimirza](https://github.com/A92hm), who kindly wrestled with Python's MSIs until they surrendered.
