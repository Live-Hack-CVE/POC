# Internet-Security-Project

Here you can find my relation about the project I made for the Internet Security course. Because I written it in Latex, you can also find the Latex source files. The project talks about Maltego vulnerability CVE-2020-24656, which allows an attacker to exfiltrate data via an XXE injection attack.
