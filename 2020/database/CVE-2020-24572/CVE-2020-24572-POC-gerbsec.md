# CVE-2020-24572-POC
An issue was discovered in includes/webconsole.php in RaspAP 2.5.

This is a remake of https://github.com/lb0x/cve-2020-24572.
If you wish to use the original click on their link.

I added payload options, and didn't limit the exploit to the hopes of having sudo rights on executing /etc/raspap/lighttpd/configport.sh
I think anyone can do sudo -l and exploit it incase it's there.
Like always this is for education purposes only.
