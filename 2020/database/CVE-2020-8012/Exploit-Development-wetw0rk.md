## Readme

# Developed Exploits

This repository will contain any exploit or proof of concept code I release publicly. In addition to this, I will include Metasploit Modules, and ported exploits.

## Metasploit Modules

This directory will contain all Metasploit modules I've developed. Note that code within this directory may be a standalone PoC in another directory.

## Ported Exploits

Exploitation is one of the hardest skills to master as a Hacker. This directory will contain vulnerabilities I have not personally discovered, but instead re-created. In order to truly understand attacks, you must take apart an exploit and try to recreate it yourself. Keep in mind this repository only contains code published on other websites / blogs. I WILL NOT place every exploit I port here (would be a lot larger).
