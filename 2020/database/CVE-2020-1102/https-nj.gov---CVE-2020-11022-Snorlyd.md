# https-nj.gov---CVE-2020-11022
#### Vulnearability Report of the New Jersey official site
Potential XSS vulnerability in jQuery.htmlPrefilter and related methods.

Passing HTML from untrusted sources - even after sanitizing it - to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. .html(), .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code.
# RECOMMENDATION
This problem is patched in jQuery 3.5.0; Therefore, it would only be necessary to update it.

To fix this bug without updating it, we can add the following code:
 
```
  jQuery.htmlPrefilter = function( html ) {
    return html;
  };
  ```
##### At least jQuery 1.12/2.2 or later is required to apply this workaround.
