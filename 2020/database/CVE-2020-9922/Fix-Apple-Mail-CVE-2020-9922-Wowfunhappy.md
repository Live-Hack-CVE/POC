# Fix-Apple-Mail-CVE-2020-9922

Apple Mail has a scary zero-click vulnerability. Versions of OS X prior to High Sierra were not patched. https://mikko-kenttala.medium.com/zero-click-vulnerability-in-apples-macos-mail-59e0c14b106c

I made this quickly and only tested it on Mavericks. I don't see any reason for it to _not_ work on other OS's, but that definitely does not mean that it will!

If you use this, feel free to open issues to tell me how it is or isn't working, because that's always cool to hear! However, I am unlikely to actually fix anything unless you're running OS X 10.9, because Mavericks is special! <3
