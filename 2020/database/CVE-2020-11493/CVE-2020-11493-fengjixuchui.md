# CVE-2020-11492

Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for Docker Desktop for Windows privilege escalation vulnerability. This vulnerability was
patched in Docker version 2.3.0.2 on May 11th, 2020.

This PoC performs the following:

- creates a named pipe mimicking docker named pipe `\\.\\pipe\\dockerLifecycleServer`,
- call `ImpersonateNamedPipeClient` after connection from docker service,
- retrieve and duplicate the impersonated access token from the current thread,
- launch a new process with the token. The new process will run as `SYSTEM`.

## Note

The right to impersonate the named pipe client is not held by standard users. To exploit, one must run this PoC as an account with the right, for example `nt authority\network service`.
