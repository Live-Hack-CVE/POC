## Readme

# Overview

Microsoft announced CVE-2020-1350 on July 14 2020. This vulnerability in Windows DNS server goes back to Server 2003
and is broadly thought to be wormable.

This script follows the intructions from KB456509 (<https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4569509/windows-dns-server-remote-code-execution-vulnerability>) to mitigate the issues without rebooting the server.

For Datto RMM users, you can import aem-component.cpt into the RMM. For other RMM users, the script simply needs command.bat and TcpRecievePacketSize.reg to work.

## Caveats
This script is only a few hours old and is not thoroughly tested. It based on the best information we have available from Microsoft right now.

Use at your own risk.
