## Readme

# CVE-2020-1472-Easy
This is definitely not something you would want to run on anything that you care about. 

Built from a writeup and work from @obfuscatee and another source

Uses code from 

https://github.com/dirkjanm/CVE-2020-1472

https://github.com/SecuraBV/CVE-2020-1472

https://github.com/VoidSec/CVE-2020-1472

https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket


Basically does a zerologon exploit, dumps the hives, extracts the machine password, reinstalls the machine password.
It seems to work but have not had a lot of time to fully test it.

Will need the latest [impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) to run it

Example run
```shell
 ./python cve-2020-1472-easymode.py -n iddc1 -i 192.168.74.130 -d internaldomain.internal
 ```
