# Citrix Analysis Notebook

A jupyter notebook to aid in automating some of the forensic analysis related to Citrix Netscaler hosts compromised via CVE-2019-19781.

For help retrieving artifacts to examine see [this Citrix triage script.](https://github.com/L4r1k/CitrixNetscalerTriageScript)

All notes/suggestions are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests or issues.

**Disclaimer: Not intended to be a be-all end-all solution, just there to help you get started.**

# Features

- Currently handles the following logs and payload XMLs if available:
  - HTTPAccess
  - HTTPError
  - Cron
  - Bash
  - Notice
  - Sh
- Decompression of logs
- Parsing of logs into pandas dataframes for further analysis if desired
- Searching of logs for common IOCs associated with compromise
- Parsing and decoding of XML payload files if available
- Output of analysis to excel results sheet for review

# Changelog

## v 1.0
* Added httperror log parsing
* Notice analysis now searches for same terms as sh analysis (sh are included in notice and thus we must search the same terms in both for the same results)
* Dataframes will now no longer be exported to the results sheet if they are empty. Instead a log message will display which dataframes are empty in the excel writing cell of the notebook.

## v 0.9
* Added retrieval of start and end date covered by each log listed above
* Refactored xml parsing code slightly to incorporate 'username' key allowing parsing of xmls retrieved from /xml/bookmarks

## v 0.8
* Added 'latin1' encoding to all log parsing to account for instances where logs were not in utf-8 and caused parsing errors
* Split searchFor into searchFor and shSearchFor as sh logs have different criteria to search that doesn't show up in other logs

## v 0.7
* Added payload decoding (chr() and base64) + aggregation of all payloads into 'decodedpayloads' column

## v 0.6
* Added sh log parsing
* Added common 'searchFor' var to config to hold search terms for suspicious activity that will be searched for in every log

## v 0.5
* Added parsing for the majority of notice logs (see errors for exceptions)
    * Exceptions are currently: sslvpn_aaad_login_handler and Session setup data send logs although they print via errors so you can still inspect them

## v 0.4
* Added bash log parsing
