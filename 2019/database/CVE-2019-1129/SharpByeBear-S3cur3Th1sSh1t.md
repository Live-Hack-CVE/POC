## Readme

# SharpByeBear

This is a weaponized version for the last Exploit published by SandboxEscaper. The vulnerability was fixed with the Windows July 2019 Patches, there are 2 CVEs, i dont know why or which one is correct: CVE-2019-1129, CVE-2019-1130.

Most of the code comes from rasta-mouse CollectorService repository (https://github.com/rasta-mouse/CollectorService). I just changed the CVE-2019-0841-Code from the original SandboxEscaper C++ Code to C# and added some checks.

The vulnerability is a race condition in the AppXSVC Service, so you need a target with multiple cores for successfull exploitation.

You can use this executable for exploitation over edge as well as cortana. Just choose the favorite application.

`SharpByeBear.exe license.rtf 1`
`Option1: edge`
`Option2: cortana`

By targeting edge you have to open edge manually after running the executable to trigger the race condition.
For cortana you can just click on the search menu in the lower left.
