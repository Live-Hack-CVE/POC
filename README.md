CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. It is a standardized system for identifying and naming software vulnerabilities. The CVE system provides a unique identifier for each known vulnerability, along with a brief description and relevant details such as severity, affected software versions, and possible solutions. This helps to ensure that vulnerabilities are tracked consistently across different organizations and platforms, and that security researchers, software developers, and end-users can quickly and easily access the information they need to understand and mitigate security risks. When a vulnerability is identified and assigned a CVE identifier, it is added to a publicly accessible CVE database, which is maintained by the MITRE Corporation in collaboration with the wider cybersecurity community.
