## Readme

This repository contains the source code for the fusee-toy project, 
my basic implementation of CVE-2018-6242 (AKA Fusée Gelée, AKA shofel2.) It was written in January 2021 to better my knowledge of the vulnerability.

This implementation has been built using the [fusee-nano](https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/fusee-nano) and
[fusee-launcher](https://github.com/Qyriad/fusee-launcher) projects as reference. 
It is built to work on modern Linux environments.
