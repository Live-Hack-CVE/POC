# Laravel exploit for CVE-2018-15133

This code exploit [CVE-2018-15133](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15133) and it is based on [kosmiz's PoC](https://github.com/kozmic/laravel-poc-CVE-2018-15133) and [Metasploit's exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47129) for this vulnerability. I pretty much just did this for a box in [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), because I did not want to use Metasploit at the moment and as a excuse for practicing Python.

From the CVE's Description:

In Laravel Framework through 5.5.40 and 5.6.x through 5.6.29, remote code execution might occur as a result of an unserialize call on a potentially untrusted X-XSRF-TOKEN value. This involves the decrypt method in Illuminate/Encryption/Encrypter.php and PendingBroadcast in gadgetchains/Laravel/RCE/3/chain.php in phpggc. The attacker must know the application key, which normally would never occur, but could happen if the attacker previously had privileged access or successfully accomplished a previous attack.

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

```
usage: pwn_laravel.py [-h] [-c COMMAND] [-m {1,2,3,4}] [-i] URL API_KEY
```

## IMPORTANT

This code was created for educational use not anything illegal. Whatever you do it's your own responsibility.
