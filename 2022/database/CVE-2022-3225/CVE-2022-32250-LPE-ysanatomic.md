# CVE-2022-32250-LPE
LPE exploit for CVE-2022-32250 - a Use-After-Free vulnerability in netfilter.

My write-up of the vulnerability: [Conquering a Use-After-Free in nf_tables: Detailed Analysis and Exploitation of CVE-2022-32250](https://ysanatomic.github.io/cve-2022-32250/) 

## Building
Building requires `libmnl` and `libnftnl`.
```
gcc -lmnl -lnftnl exploit.c -o exploit
```

## Reliability
The vulnerability impacts both versions that have only `KMALLOC_NORMAL` caches and those that also have `KMALLOC_CGROUP`. When making the exploit I only used primitives that would work in both cases - however, testing was conducted on `5.12` which has just `KMALLOC_NORMAL` caches. In theory it works in both cases - in practice, it might take a little bit of work. 

The reliability of the exploit is reasonable - bottlenecked by the key limit in Linux which limits our object spraying capabilities (the limit is 200 for non-root users).

The exploit is a **Proof-of-Concept** and is able to achieve local privilege escalation on `5.12.0`. It was not my goal to weaponize it so I cannot at all speak about its reliance on any other version.
