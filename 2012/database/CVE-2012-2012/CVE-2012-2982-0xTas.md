## Readme

**This PoC exploit for CVE-2012-2982 was written as an exercise for the "Intro to PoC scripting" Room on TryHackMe**. <br>

The room can be found here: https://tryhackme.com/room/intropocscripting <br>

I was originally going to use Python to follow along, but decided to practice my Rust skills instead.<br>

I also saw that nearly every single non-Metasploit implementation on Github was in Python, 
so I figured that bringing something new to the table might be fun.

### Usage

**Note:** The program spawns a Netcat listener by default.
If Netcat isn't in your path, or you want to run your own listener, run the program with the `-d` flag.

**From Source (Rust and Cargo required):**<br>
```bash
# To get detailed info about arguments:
cargo run -- --help

# General command structure:
cargo run -- <rhost> <lhost> <username> <password> [options]
```
<br>

**From Binary:**<br>
```bash
# To get detailed info about arguments:
./cve-2012-2982 --help

# General command structure:
./cve-2012-2982 <rhost> <lhost> <username> <password> [options]
```
<br>

**Program defaults:**<br>
1. rport=10000 (Webmin's default)<br>
2. lport=1337<br>
3. payload = generic bash tcp reverse shell<br>
